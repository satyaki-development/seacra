Everyone's body and skin are different, so there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to skincare. However, natural products can help your skin heal itself with less harsh chemicals involved.\n      <\/p>\n   <\/div>\n   \n   <div class=\"line1\" >\n     <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0669\/6343\/9927\/files\/Group_970.png?v=1668752390\">\n  <div class=\"line2\" >\n  <span >1: Natural Skincare treatment will improve your skin's health<br>\n  <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n  <\/span>\n  <div style=\"font-size:13px;padding:0px 35px;\">Natural treatments work with your body's chemistry and promote better health in general—whereas chemical treatments often do the opposite. Most chemical treatments damage the skin barrier. The skin’s barrier is something that has been long forgotten. It is not spoken about in messaging from brands and people focus on the way they look rather than the health of their skin —and so they undergo these chemical treatments despite possible side effects like dryness and inflammation. We want to change this. We want to educate our audience about improving the health of their skin as the number one priority, which in turn will help them to naturally treat their skin concerns.\n\n    Natural ingredients, like Red Algae, help stimulate cell turnover rates and support collagen production—allowing for firmer skin. Along with Chamomile, Jojoba and Calendula are all ingredients known for their detoxifying, moisturising and soothing properties. When combined, these ingredients provide not only a temporary solution to skin problems but also long-term benefits like healthy skin.\n  \n  <\/div>\n\n  <div class=\"line1\" >\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0669\/6343\/9927\/files\/Group_970.png?v=1668752390\">\n <div class=\"line2\" >\n <span >2: Natural Skincare Treatments Can Tackle Many Skin Issues At Once<br>\n <\/div>\n <\/div>\n <\/span>\n <div style=\"font-size:13px;padding:0px 35px;\">Natural skincare treatments don’t just treat one issue at a time – they address multiple concerns at once! Ingredients from nature usually have multiple bioactive compounds that can address multiple skin concerns. However, chemical treatments usually include a single compound to target one concern at a time and often end up causing side effects like skin sensitivity, dryness or redness.\n \n <\/div>\n\n <div class=\"line1\" >\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0669\/6343\/9927\/files\/Group_970.png?v=1668752390\">\n<div class=\"line2\" >\n<span >3: By avoiding harsh chemicals in your skincare products, you're also protecting the environment<br>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/span>\n<div style=\"font-size:13px;padding:0px 35px;\">Traditional products often contain chemicals that are harmful to wildlife—and the environment. But natural alternatives are better for both our health and nature's well-being! By choosing organic ingredients over artificial ones, we're helping keep our planet clean and healthy for future generations.\n  \n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"line1\" >\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0669\/6343\/9927\/files\/Group_970.png?v=1668752390\">\n<div class=\"line2\" >\n<span >Clinically proven to be as effective as medicated treatments but 100% natural<br>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/span>\n<div style=\"font-size:13px;padding:0px 35px;\">Astaxanthin is nature’s strongest antioxidant and the bio-active compound in red algae – the core ingredient of the Recovery & Repair Gel. Astaxanthin works with the skin to improve the health of your cells and strengthen your skin barrier.\n\nAstaxanthin also acts as a transporter for the other ingredients in our gel, Chamomile, Jojoba and Calendula, meaning they are more effective at repairing the cells of your skin. As well as improving your skin, The Recovery & Repair Gel actively amplifies the effects of any other skincare product in your daily regimen.\n\nAs the gel is 100% natural, there are no side-effects which is particularly important for someone using the gel to manage their rosacea or acne symptoms. There are not the usual side-effects, so there is less downtime, no need to take a break from using our gel and therefore limited flare-ups, enabling them to manage their condition effectively. Being sustainable is of high importance to us, from our packaging, to using less products, to planting a tree in the Madagascan rainforest with every purchase. We want the Recovery & Repair gel to be sustainable for your skin and the planet.\n\nThe Recovery & Repair Gel itself contains ten times more Vitamin A than Retinol, 6,000 times more potent than Vitamin C and 550 times more potent than Vitamin E. It’s also more hydrating than Hyaluronic Acid and has a better inflammatory effect than most anti-inflammatory drugs. Basically, your skin’s new best friend.The smooth and thin layer of red algae can be a wonderful moisturizer for the skin due to its richness in natural metabolites. It is proven that polysaccharides in red algae have a greater moisturizing effect than hyaluronic acid does.\n<\/div>\n\n\n<div class=\"look-img\">\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0669\/6343\/9927\/files\/Group_1198.png?v=1671176055\"><\/img>\n<\/div>",
