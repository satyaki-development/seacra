It takes a toll on your skin and if not addressed in time, can cause permanent scarring. Eczema can affect you at any time of life, even as a child. Many people have turned to natural methods to get rid of Eczema on the face. Here is one natural method that works extremely well.\n\n      We came across Red Algae when searching for how to get rid of Eczema on the face naturally. Unlike other companies, ours is processed in a way that preserves its natural nutrients, ensuring that you get 10x the potency of other brands.\n      \n      Before we get into how Red Algae can help your condition, you should first be aware of your condition.\n      <\/p>\n   <\/div>\n   \n   <div class=\"line1\" >\n     <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0669\/6343\/9927\/files\/Group_970.png?v=1668752390\">\n  <div class=\"line2\" >\n  <span >Eczema: The Truth Behind the Flare-Ups<br>\n  <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n  <\/span>\n  <div style=\"font-size:13px;padding:0px 35px;\">People with Eczema have an impaired skin barrier, which can cause problems with hydration and other issues. The outer layer of the skin, which forms a barrier to keep our bodies well hydrated, is called the epidermis. The dryness that accompanies Eczema is caused by the failure of the epidermis to perform its normal functions.\n\n    To minimise the symptoms of Eczema from developing, you need to minimise your exposure to potential triggers. Depending on the type of Eczema, the triggers can range from chemicals, ultraviolet rays, and dryness to food allergies and contact with animals or specific types of fabrics.\n  \n  <\/div>\n\n  <div class=\"line1\" >\n    <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0669\/6343\/9927\/files\/Group_970.png?v=1668752390\">\n <div class=\"line2\" >\n <span >Types of Eczema<br>\n <\/div>\n <\/div>\n <\/span>\n <div style=\"font-size:13px;padding:0px 35px;\">There are different types of eczema skin conditions. Atopic dermatitis, the most common Eczema, involves a dry, itchy rash. Contact dermatitis is a skin reaction to certain substances, such as poison ivy and nickel. Dyshidrotic Eczema causes small blisters on the hands' palms or soles of feet, while discoid Eczema occurs in round patches above elbows and knees. Varicose Eczema often occurs alongside varicose veins and can be found on the lower legs; asteatotic Eczema is common in older adults and mostly affects the lower legs.\n\n  Because there are many types of Eczema, you cannot self-diagnose your condition. You will need a doctor to determine what type of Eczema you have.\n \n <\/div>\n\n <div class=\"line1\" >\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0669\/6343\/9927\/files\/Group_970.png?v=1668752390\">\n<div class=\"line2\" >\n<span >How Can Red Algae Help Eczema Symptoms?<br>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/span>\n<div style=\"font-size:13px;padding:0px 35px;\">Marine Algae is a source of natural-derived antioxidants that can help combat inflammatory skin diseases. Several studies have demonstrated that bioactive compounds isolated from the algae have anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative properties that can help remedy various skin diseases.\n\n  Red Algae is a type of marine algae used for centuries in Asian countries for its medicinal benefits. It is known for its potent antioxidant properties and ability to protect against UV light damage.\n  \n  Red Algae has been shown to improve eczema symptoms by reducing inflammation, itching and restoring moisture levels in the skin.\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"line1\" >\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0669\/6343\/9927\/files\/Group_970.png?v=1668752390\">\n<div class=\"line2\" >\n<span >How to Get Rid of Eczema Discolouration?<br>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/span>\n<div style=\"font-size:13px;padding:0px 35px;\">Eczema discolouration can be a difficult problem to treat. Eczema leaves behind hyperpigmentation (dark spots) and hypopigmentation (white patches). Even after Eczema is treated, the discolouration can last for months or years.\n\n  Eczema sufferers wish to avoid the side effects of chemicals; their main question is how to get rid of discolouration naturally?\n  \n  Red algae also have anti-melanogenic properties, which means its bioactive compounds help inhibit the overproduction of melanin, which gives our skin its colour. Overproduction of it leads to pigmentations.\n  \n  Red algae can be a good solution for helping to heal your eczema discolouration naturally.\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"line1\" >\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0669\/6343\/9927\/files\/Group_970.png?v=1668752390\">\n<div class=\"line2\" >\n<span >Seacra's Red Algae Gel: Recovery & Repair Gel<br>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/span>\n<div style=\"font-size:13px;padding:0px 35px;\"><span style=\"color: #CC4E61;font-size: 13px;font-style: normal;\">Restore Balance with Seacra's Recovery & Repair Gel:<\/span> Seacra's Recovery & Repair Gel has been designed to incorporate the healing properties of Red Algae.
