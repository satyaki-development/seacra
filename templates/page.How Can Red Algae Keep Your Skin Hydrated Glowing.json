Your skin gets dehydrated naturally because of its outermost layer called the epidermis. The epidermis is made up of cells that are known as keratinocytes. Keratinocytes get dehydrated due to lack of moisture. Dehydrated skin looks dull and tired and causes premature aging, fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\nNow you're asking how to keep skin hydrated. Well, thanks to the sea where most natural elements are found, we have brought Red Algae from the ocean for you. Studies have shown that it is one of the best ways to keep your skin healthy and glowing.\n<\/div>",
