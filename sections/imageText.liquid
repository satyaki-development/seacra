<h2> Join our journey to<span style="color: #CC4E61;"> healthy skin</h2>

  <p>Seacra was founded in 2021. We realised that most skincare treatments unintentionally damage your skin. You buy a product to treat blemishes and end up with dry, irritated skin. We noticed that there was a gap in the market for a 100% natural product that was as effective as medicated treatments.
Time and time again we saw friends and family members frequenting dermatologist and doctorâ€™s offices. Prescribed treatments for acne and rosacea, being subject to a host of negative side-effects, stopping treatment and then the cycle of flare-ups and unhappiness began again.
